## Install

Grab the latest APK from [Releases](../../releases). Requires Android 10+.

Haze asks for media access and, optionally, All files access (used for faster folder operations, EXIF from the real file and the 30-day trash purge).

## Build

```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Release builds use the debug key unless `KEYSTORE_FILE`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `KEY_PASSWORD` are set. Tagging `v*` runs the release workflow, which signs with the repository secrets of the same names (plus `KEYSTORE_BASE64`).

## Stack

Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, DataStore, Coil, Media3. Package `sleepless_index.haze`, min SDK 29.

## Notes

- Android 10 has no system trash, so deleting there is permanent after the system prompt.
- Rare audio codecs (DTS, some E-AC3) depend on the device's decoders.
